# IPL-Project-use-data-visualization
The IPL Project uses data visualization to analyze team performance, player stats, and match trends through charts and dashboards, helping identify key patterns, top performers, and winning strategies.

Pick 2–4 questions the project must answer (e.g., top run-scorers, impact of toss, venue advantage, predicting match winners).

Collect data
Get match-level and ball-by-ball datasets (matches, deliveries), player info, and optionally venue/weather/toss data from sources like Kaggle or ESPNcricinfo.

Load & inspect
Load CSVs with pandas, inspect columns, types, missing values and basic counts.
Example: pd.read_csv('deliveries.csv', parse_dates=['date']).

Clean & normalize
Fix team/name inconsistencies, convert types (dates, numeric), fill/drop missing, remove duplicates. Standardize season labels and venue names.

Feature engineering
Create useful columns: strike rate (runs/balls*100), economy (runs_conceded/overs), run rate, partnership runs, wicket types, home/away flag, recent form (last N matches), rolling averages.

Aggregate datasets
Build summaries per player, per team, and per season: total runs, average, strike rate, wickets, economy, wins by season, head-to-head matrices.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use histograms, boxplots, pairplots, correlation matrix to spot distributions/outliers and relationships (e.g., batting order vs. win %).

Design visualizations
Map each question to a chart type:

Top scorers → horizontal bar chart

Runs by season → line chart / area chart

Venue advantage → heatmap (venue × team win%)

Strike rate vs. average → scatter with trendline

Wagon-wheel/shot maps (ball-by-ball) → custom pitch visualization

Make them interactive
Use Plotly/Bokeh/Altair or dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit, Dash) to add filters (season, team, player), hover tooltips, and drilldowns.

Build the dashboard layout
Typical layout: KPIs row (matches, avg runs, top player), left-side filters, main canvas with 3–4 charts, bottom with detailed table and match timeline.

Extract insights & storytelling
Turn charts into short findings: e.g., “Team X wins 65% when top 3 average > Y” or “Player A’s strike rate jumps in powerplay.” Write 1–2 sentence takeaway for each chart.

(Optional) Predictive modeling
If predicting winners, prepare features (recent form, toss, venue, avg scores), split data chronologically, train simple models (logistic regression / random forest), validate (accuracy, ROC AUC), and visualize feature importance.

Validate & test
Sanity-check results against known facts (top scorers, historic winners). Ask peers to validate interpretations.

Deploy & share
Publish to Tableau Public / Power BI service / Streamlit app or GitHub (notebooks + exported visuals). Provide README with how to reproduce.

Future improvements
Add ball-by-ball visualizations, player similarity search, win-probability models, or social-media sentiment overlay.

Quick code snippet (start)
import pandas as pd
# load
matches = pd.read_csv('matches.csv', parse_dates=['date'])
deliveries = pd.read_csv('deliveries.csv')

# top run scorers
runs = deliveries.groupby('batsman')['batsman_runs'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10).reset_index()
runs.columns = ['batsman', 'runs']

# quick Plotly bar (interactive)
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.bar(runs, x='batsman', y='runs', title='Top 10 Run Scorers')
fig.show()
